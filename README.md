### Will update icons when I experiment with more stuff.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a real estate broker but hoping to pivot into testing or software development. I went through 2 small bootcamps which gave me a solid base in Python and a great introduction to testing, Java, Javascript and HTML
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mostly focused on learning coding by trying out new concepts and libraries on small yet non-trivial projects. Things that make my life easier now or would have some years ago
- âš¡ Hobbies and interests: 
-  :bulb: I have been writing fiction since I was 12. I published one novel in 2013 and my current project is now updated in English on [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43056/stories-from-the-lost-county)
- :bulb: I also have a longstanding passion and interest for computer hardware. Including legacy and historic hardware. With my new skills I can now hope to get into legacy software and code as well.
Other than that, I have flashed custom ROMs on mp3 players, played around with custom kernels on early Android phones, I can assemble my own PC from components, also a workstation laptop and hope to soon get into Linux as well
- :bulb: I have also been interested in cars for as long as I remember, these days more about old cars.
